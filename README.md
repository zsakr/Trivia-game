# Trivia-game
The game will start with asking the user multiple questions. These questions are going to be based on his/her educational background to decide which level of the game you are qualified for. For ex: 
        if choose elementary school will be qualified for easy/Medium level 
   However we will give them the choice if they want to stay with this level or want to change to another level. 
   The game is going to work with asking the user about their favorite subjects (History, Math, Science, geography) and the questions are going to be based on these choices.
   Also, we are going to give them 3 lives and if they used all the lives then they can choose to play again or quit the game.
